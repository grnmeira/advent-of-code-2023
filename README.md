# Advent of Code 2023
This repository contains solutions for some of the AoC 2023 problems in Rust. Note that most of the code was written from my mobile, so apologies if it's not readable enough ðŸ¤“

I also have here a PDF with notes used to solve some of the problems. For day 6, I didn't write any code as the solution could be obtaining solving quadratic functions.
